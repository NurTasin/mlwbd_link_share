# mlwbd_link_share
If you try to share any link from mlwbd.mobi using any 
social messaging site then you will be unable to share that.

This is the middle man between you and mlwbd.mobi .
Now an instance of this app is running on heroku.com .
And you can use that and share your links...

<h3>What you have to do</h3>
The only thing you need to do is just remove the ".mobi" 
part from the original site and put ".herokuapp.com" and you
are good to go.
